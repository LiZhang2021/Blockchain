# Double-Spending Analysis of DAG-Based Blockchain in Wireless Blockchain Network

## Abstract


## Introduction 


## Preliminaries

In this section, we introduce the characteristics of wireless network and the consensus protocol of DAG-based blockchain respectively. Then, we describe the main procedures that a new transaction is accepted by all nodes in the wireless network whose communication protocol is CSMA/CA protocol.

### Wireless Network 

Wireless Local Area Networks(WLANs)[1-2] with high flexibility and convenience can provide high quality services for users in limited geographical area. Currently, as the de facto standard of WLANs, IEEE 802.11[1] has been wirdly used in wireless network. This standard include Distributed Coordination Function(DCF)[3] as Medium Access Control(MAC)[1] mechanism. The DCF, which based on Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance(CSMA/CA) and binary slotted exponential backoff, can support asynchronous data transfer on a best effort basis. In this paper, we consider that any node broacasts a packe competely by using CSMA/CA for media access wireless channel.
